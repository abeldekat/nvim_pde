-- Notice that this is a different approach for changing the compiler engine.
-- I personally prefer using this approach, because it is also recognized by other editors.
-- So, as a sensible solution, I think you should simplify your config to something like the following
-- and then use the tex program directive for specifying the engine:
-- %! TeX program = lualatex
